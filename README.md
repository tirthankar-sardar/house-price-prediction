House Prices Prediction using Advanced Regression Techniques
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning regression models. Built for the Ames Housing dataset, this notebook implements feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model tuning with XGBoost, aiming to achieve a low RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) on the Kaggle competition leaderboard.
